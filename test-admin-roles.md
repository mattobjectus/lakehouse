# Admin Role Testing Guide

This document outlines how to test that both "Admin" and "ADMIN" roles work correctly for administration access.

## Backend Changes Made

1. **User Model (`User.java`)**:

   - Added `Admin` to the Role enum alongside existing `USER` and `ADMIN`
   - Added `isAdmin()` helper method that returns true for both `Role.ADMIN` and `Role.Admin`

2. **UserDetailsServiceImpl**:

   - Updated to grant `ROLE_ADMIN` authority for both admin role variants
   - Uses the `isAdmin()` method to normalize admin roles

3. **Spring Security**:
   - All existing `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` annotations continue to work
   - Both "Admin" and "ADMIN" users will have `ROLE_ADMIN` authority

## Frontend Changes Made

1. **AuthContext**:

   - Added `isAdmin()` function that checks for both "ADMIN" and "Admin" roles
   - Function returns `user?.role === "ADMIN" || user?.role === "Admin"`

2. **Navbar Component**:

   - Updated to use `isAdmin()` function instead of hardcoded role check
   - Administration menu item now shows for both role variants

3. **Administration Page**:
   - Updated to use `isAdmin()` function for access control
   - Page accessible to users with either "Admin" or "ADMIN" roles

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Database Setup

Create test users with both role variants:

```sql
-- User with "ADMIN" role (existing format)
INSERT INTO users (username, email, first_name, last_name, password, role)
VALUES ('admin1', 'admin1@test.com', 'Admin', 'One', '$2a$10$...', 'ADMIN');

-- User with "Admin" role (new format)
INSERT INTO users (username, email, first_name, last_name, password, role)
VALUES ('admin2', 'admin2@test.com', 'Admin', 'Two', '$2a$10$...', 'Admin');
```

### 2. Backend API Testing

Test that both users can access admin-only endpoints:

```bash
# Test with ADMIN role user
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token_for_admin1>" \
     http://localhost:8082/api/users

# Test with Admin role user
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token_for_admin2>" \
     http://localhost:8082/api/users

# Both should return 200 OK with user list
```

### 3. Frontend Testing

1. Login with user having "ADMIN" role

   - Verify Administration menu item appears in navbar
   - Verify Administration page is accessible
   - Verify all admin functions work (create duties, assign duties, etc.)

2. Login with user having "Admin" role

   - Verify Administration menu item appears in navbar
   - Verify Administration page is accessible
   - Verify all admin functions work (create duties, assign duties, etc.)

3. Login with regular "USER" role
   - Verify Administration menu item does NOT appear
   - Verify direct navigation to /administration shows access denied message

## Expected Results

- ✅ Users with "ADMIN" role can access all administration features
- ✅ Users with "Admin" role can access all administration features
- ✅ Users with "USER" role cannot access administration features
- ✅ Backend API endpoints respect both admin role variants
- ✅ Frontend UI shows/hides admin features correctly for both variants
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing "ADMIN" users continue to work unchanged
2. **Flexibility**: Supports both "Admin" and "ADMIN" role naming conventions
3. **Centralized Logic**: Role checking logic is centralized in helper methods
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to extend for additional admin role variants if needed
5. **Secure**: All existing security annotations continue to work properly
